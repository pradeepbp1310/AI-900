### Section 1: AI Workloads and Considerations

Let's begin with the absolute basics.

**What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?**

At its core, **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to the ability of machines or computer systems to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes things like:

- **Learning:** Acquiring information and rules for using the information.
- **Reasoning:** Using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions.
- **Problem-solving:** Finding solutions to complex problems.
- **Perception:** Using senses (like sight or hearing) to understand the world.
- **Language Understanding:** Comprehending and generating human language.

Think of it as programming computers to "think" or "learn" in a way that mimics human cognitive functions.

**Common AI Workloads**

This is where we see how AI is applied to solve real-world problems.

"Common AI Workloads" are essentially the different categories of problems that AI is particularly good at solving.

Here are the key common AI workloads:

1.  **Machine Learning (ML):**

    - **What it is:** This is the most fundamental and widely used type of AI. It involves training models to find patterns in data and then use those patterns to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data, _without being explicitly programmed for every single scenario_.
    - **Examples:** Predicting house prices, identifying spam emails, recommending products (like Netflix or Amazon recommendations).

2.  **Computer Vision (CV):**

    - **What it is:** This area of AI enables computers to "see" and interpret visual information from images and videos, mimicking the human visual system.
    - **Examples:** Facial recognition for unlocking phones, detecting objects in a picture (e.g., identifying cars, people, or traffic signs in an autonomous vehicle), optical character recognition (OCR) to extract text from scanned documents or images.

3.  **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**

    - **What it is:** NLP focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language (both spoken and written).
    - **Examples:** Sentiment analysis (determining if a review is positive or negative), language translation (e.g., Google Translate), key phrase extraction from text, speech-to-text (converting voice to written words), text-to-speech (converting written words to spoken voice).

4.  **Conversational AI:**

    - **What it is:** This refers to AI systems designed to interact with humans using natural conversation, often through text or speech. It frequently leverages NLP.
    - **Examples:** Chatbots for customer service, virtual assistants (like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant), intelligent agents that can answer questions.

5.  **Knowledge Mining:**

    - **What it is:** This involves intelligently searching across large volumes of unstructured data (like documents, emails, transcripts, or notes) to extract information, discover patterns, and gain insights. It often combines elements of search, AI, and data analytics.
    - **Examples:** Searching legal documents for relevant clauses, finding trends in customer feedback across thousands of reviews, extracting specific data points from invoices.

6.  **Generative AI:**
    - **What it is:** This is a newer and rapidly evolving field of AI that focuses on creating _new_, original content (like text, images, audio, or even code) that is similar to human-created content. It learns from vast datasets to generate novel outputs.
    - **Examples:** ChatGPT (generating human-like text), DALL-E or Midjourney (generating images from text descriptions), creating music, writing code.
